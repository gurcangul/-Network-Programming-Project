Daemons everywhere!
Please revise at least 2 servers used in the previous chapters, such as multithreaded or multiprocess servers, and add daemonizing, dropping priviledges, chroot jailing, and logging to those servers.. so that they log their activities to syslog, and run as a regular user, and run chrooted to some directory.

Provide the source codes and screenshots of your servers please..
